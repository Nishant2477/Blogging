        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way developers write code. Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are enabling developers to generate code snippets, debug errors, and even create entire applications with minimal effort.</p>
        <p>These AI-powered tools are not just about convenience; they are about enhancing productivity and reducing the time spent on repetitive tasks. By automating mundane coding tasks, developers can focus on solving complex problems and building innovative solutions.</p>
        <p>One of the key benefits of AI-powered code generation is its ability to learn from vast amounts of data. These tools are trained on millions of lines of code, enabling them to provide accurate and context-aware suggestions. This not only speeds up development but also helps in maintaining code quality.</p>
        <p>However, the rise of AI in software development also raises questions about the future of coding. Will AI replace developers? Experts believe that while AI can assist in coding, it cannot replace the creativity and problem-solving skills of human developers. Instead, it will act as a powerful assistant, enabling developers to achieve more in less time.</p>
